# alwenia_assets
My assets from Open Hexagon.


(sry for my bad english/english mistakes because i didn't remember for you how to use it ;_;)

hello.
thanks for downloading my OH resource pack called: < -_alwenia_- >

today i going to show you how to change your OH assets and adding the scripts of levelpackers
on open hexagon. so let's talk about the assets first.

# assets.

-sounds-
beep.ogg, select.ogg, death.ogg, restart.ogg -- taken from Hexagon Evolved - belongs to Richman stewart
error.ogg -- this sound effect file i recorded from nintendo switch's error bullshiet sound effect... and yea
openHexagon.ogg, go.ogg, levelUp.ogg, & gameOver.ogg -- inspired from Jenn Frank's super hexagon announcer sound effect - belongs to Terry

-graphics-

-= this assets now used from Open Square font (Courtesy of Morxemplum) =-
epilepsyWarning.png -- add some epilepsy warning message to make more accurate/elegant, and warning sign replaced to...shocked bowser...? maybe not
titleBar.png -- is now added w/ [(depressed Marchionne (belongs to CorpseSyndrome | Team ARI) + creating some LeaF's MARENOL design * hexagon logical) * now minimalist design]
bottomBar.png, creditsBar1.png, creditsBar2.png, creditsBar2b.png, and creditsBar2c.png -- is now transperent to 50%
creditsBar2d.png -- set transperent to 50% too, removed game & discord donation message, now adding resource pack & inspiration infomation

-font assets-
OH v19.2, v2 RC1, v2 release build 06.16.2020 users >>>
imagine.ttf -- imagine font replaced into Morxemplum's Open Square font...nothing special.

OH v2.0 release build 06.29.2020 (non-steam release), v2.x.x+ steam release/compiled new version of OH users >>>
forcedsquare.ttf & OpenSquare-Bold.ttf -- FORCED SQUARE & Open Square Bold replaced into
Nintendo's/aruanticus' MARIO Font v3.2 Solid font (like ***accurate/legit*** Super Mario logo's new era) - includes katana and etc...

oh and this font IS my favorite and i like this font but eh...

"i like nintendo, i like mario, mario is a great community..." -Puz, 2019

OpenSquare-Regular.ttf -- Open Square Regular replaced into PopHappinessStd-EB font (belongs to Fontworks Inc.),
btw - also...this font had no katana glyph in it (same as delfino font from
super mario sunshine & galaxy ui font) because attempting to import .otf file from glyphr studio with
katana glyph...IT TOOK TOO LONG TO LOAD and MY BROWSER PAGE SUDDENLY DIDN'T RESPONDING for me ;_; (rip katana glyph)

about my <Mario font on Open Hexagon 2.x.x+ steam release> - .otf to .ttf converter plan >>>
- i downloaded the mario font from yell0wsuit's github page in it
- i deciding to convert .otf to .ttf file... but the otf conversion doesn't feel good
- deciding plan B, glyphr studio. i decide to IMPORT font w/ ACTUAL .otf file correctly so that i can convert .otf to .ttf correctly... 
- decidng to load .otf font file (w/ correctly from glyphr studio), loaded normally and yes
- it's looks like the font size was too big, so i normalize this font to accurate size instead
- ...and this one too. space glyph. deciding to repairing it.
- repairing the glyph shape to how accurate glyph was, such as digit numbers one and three.
- generate font to .ttf, sudden this is happened how, but it works.

*but unfortunately, the title screen & level selection had some weird going on about
 text y-height misalignment since OH 2.0.5 public beta/early access for some reason...*
[DISCLAIMER - This font BELONGS to Nintendo and Fontworks Inc....and I DO NOT OWN OF ANY FONT AND OWNERSHIP]
...and plus, SHOUTOUTS TO purifiedh20/aruanticus/yell0wsuit to HOW ACCURATE THE MARIO FONT WAS

# replacing assets

- dump the assets from <<.../[ assets ]/-graphics-/>> & <<.../[ assets ]/-sounds-/>> of inner .zip file to <<.../Open Hexagon/Assets/>>,
  of course you can unzip it on your folder directory, for example: adding your folder, etc.
  and don't forget to add bottomBar.png -- click on bottom bar folder which resolution is fit, select version what do you want
- for bonus assets: it is possible to replacing the font from <<.../[ assets ]/-fonts-/>>

"If you mean the font 'forced square' or 'open square' instead, open the game's folder,
(Located in your steam folder, at steamapps/common/Open Hexagon)
head into assets, then do whatever with forcedsquare.ttf or even OpenSquare-Bold.ttf and OpenSquare-Regular.ttf"

"or if you don't feel like going exploring with windows explorer, open steam,
right click 'open hexagon' in your library, click properties, click local files,
click browse local files to get to the game's folder"

-Trollbreeder, 2020

"just rename for forcedsquare.ttf or even OpenSquare-Bold.ttf and OpenSquare-Regular.ttf to [current_font_name]_o.ttf
then copypaste the current ones from <<.../[ assets ]/-graphics-/>> into assets and
rename it to forcedsquare.ttf or even OpenSquare-Bold.ttf and OpenSquare-Regular.ttf"

# adding lua scripts

for OH v1.92 & v2 non steam release users >>>
- add these script on <<.../[ scripts ]/marchionne's base scripts/Scripts/>> directory to <<.../Open Hexagon/Packs/[pack_name]/Scripts/>>

for OH v2.0.4+ steam release/compiled latest version of OH users >>>
- add these dependency script on <<.../[ scripts ]/>> directory on 'marchionne's base scripts' folder to <<.../Open Hexagon/Packs/>>,
  and don't forget to make sure your pack has a dependency in it (with good JSON syntax), see example: <<.../Open Hexagon/Packs/cube/pack.json>>,
  if you don't have any directories or the pack you saw the dependencies can't be found, you can see the github's Open Hexagon page, see example: <<.../_RELEASE/Packs/cube/pack.json>> -- for OH steam/compiled game users
